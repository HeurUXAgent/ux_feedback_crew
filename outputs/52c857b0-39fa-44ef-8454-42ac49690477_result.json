  "wireframe": "I am unable to generate the improved mobile UI wireframe in HTML/CSS due to a persistent internal error with the `create_wireframe` tool. The tool consistently returns the error `name 'screen_type' is not defined`, preventing the successful creation of the wireframe.\n\nHad the tool been functional, the wireframe would have implemented the following based on the provided `vision_analysis` and general mobile-first design best practices (as no specific feedback items could be processed due to an upstream error in the analysis phase):\n\n**Improved Mobile UI Wireframe (Conceptual Description):**\n\n*   **Mobile-First Design (375px width, Responsive):**\n    *   The design would be optimized for a 375px mobile viewport, ensuring readability and touch-friendliness.\n    *   It would be responsive, adapting gracefully to slightly larger or smaller mobile screens.\n\n*   **Clean, Modern Styling:**\n    *   A minimalist aesthetic with a focus on usability and clarity.\n    *   Modern, flat, or subtle material design elements.\n    *   A coherent color scheme with good contrast for accessibility.\n\n*   **Proper Spacing and Typography:**\n    *   Ample whitespace to reduce cognitive load and improve readability.\n    *   Consistent padding and margins between elements.\n    *   Legible sans-serif typography with a clear hierarchy for headings, subheadings, and body text.\n    *   Appropriate font sizes and line heights for mobile readability.\n\n*   **Interactive and Exportable HTML (if tool worked):**\n    *   The generated output would have been an HTML file with embedded CSS, demonstrating the visual improvements.\n    *   Interactive elements (buttons, links) would be present, even if not fully functional in a static wireframe.\n\n*   **Clear Visual Improvements:**\n    *   The design would inherently be an improvement by adhering to best practices, ensuring a polished and user-friendly interface.\n\n**Specific UI Elements (as per `vision_analysis`):**\n\n1.  **Top Navigation Bar:**\n    *   **Left:** App Title/Logo for brand identity.\n    *   **Right:** Action icons (e.g., Hamburger menu for navigation, Profile icon for user settings). Icons would be clearly distinguishable and touch-friendly.\n\n2.  **Welcoming Message:**\n    *   A personalized greeting to the user (e.g., \"Hello, [User Name]!\").\n    *   Clear and inviting typography, prominently placed below the top bar.\n\n3.  **Digestible Information Cards:**\n    *   Multiple cards displaying key metrics (e.g., \"Total Sales\", \"Pending Orders\", \"New Customers\").\n    *   Each card would feature a clear title, a prominent metric value, and potentially a small trend indicator or subtitle.\n    *   Cards would be arranged in a grid or stack, easy to scan and digest.\n\n4.  **Recent Activity/Notifications List:**\n    *   A dedicated section displaying recent user activities or notifications.\n    *   Each item would show a brief description, a relevant icon, and a timestamp.\n    *   Clear separation between list items for readability.\n\n5.  **Sticky Bottom Navigation Bar:**\n    *   Essential app sections (e.g., Home, Search, Messages, Profile) easily accessible.\n    *   Consistently visible at the bottom of the screen.\n    *   Each item would have an icon and a text label, with the active item clearly highlighted.\n\nIn summary, I am unable to provide the actual HTML/CSS code for the improved wireframe due to a critical error in the `create_wireframe` tool. However, the design *would* have been a clean, modern, mobile-first dashboard, incorporating the elements described above with a strong focus on usability, visual hierarchy, and best practices in typography and spacing."
