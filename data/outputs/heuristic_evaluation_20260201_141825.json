      "issue": "The description does not mention explicit feedback mechanisms for interactive elements (e.g., visual tap feedback for cards) or loading indicators when data fetching occurs (e.g., after selecting a quiz category). Users might wonder if their tap was registered or if the app is working when transitioning to a new screen or fetching content.",

      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "severity": "low",
      "issue": "The 'Beginner' text, rendered in light gray on various gradient backgrounds, along with black icons on gradients, presents potential contrast issues. While overall consistency in layout and typography is good, this color choice for text/icons isn't consistently accessible across all card backgrounds, potentially violating a standard of accessible design.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "Review and adjust text and icon colors to ensure sufficient contrast ratios against all gradient backgrounds, especially for 'Beginner' labels and small icons. Consider using a darker text color or adding a subtle background shade behind the text/icons to improve legibility and meet accessibility standards."

      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The '27' prominently displayed at the top-right provides a clear and continuous visible status of the user's points or currency, which is a good example of keeping the user informed in a gamified context."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI uses clear, familiar language ('Quiz Pool', 'Redeem', 'MATHS', 'GK', 'SCIENCE', 'Beginner') and commonly recognized icons (hamburger menu, gift box, star outline, thematic quiz images). The system navigation bar uses standard Android icons, reinforcing familiar interaction patterns. The concepts align well with user expectations for a quiz application."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "observation": "The presence of the standard Android system navigation bar (with 'back', 'home', 'recent apps' icons) at the bottom provides a universal and clearly marked 'emergency exit' and robust user control. The hamburger menu also offers broader navigation options."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The design demonstrates strong internal consistency through the extensive use of card-based UI for both actions and categories. There is consistent vertical and horizontal spacing, ample padding within cards, and a clear typography hierarchy. The 'QUIZ' label has a consistent visual style, and the app adheres to platform standards for system navigation."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "observation": "As a home screen primarily focused on navigation and information display, the design inherently prevents many user errors. There are no complex input fields or destructive actions presented on this screen that would require specific error prevention mechanisms like confirmation dialogs or input validation."
