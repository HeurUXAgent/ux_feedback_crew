      "issue": "While the active state of the 'Home' navigation item and countdown timers provide some status, the UI description does not explicitly mention comprehensive system feedback for all user interactions (e.g., adding an item to cart, favoriting a product) or clear loading indicators for content fetching. Users might be left wondering if an action was successful or if content is still loading, particularly when network conditions are poor.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "Implement clear visual feedback for all interactive elements upon tap (e.g., button pressed states). Provide distinct loading indicators (e.g., skeleton screens, spinners) for sections where content is being fetched. Display brief, transient success messages or confirmations for key user actions."

      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "severity": "medium",
      "issue": "The home screen prominently features elements for forward navigation ('Right arrow' icons for various sections) but lacks an explicit 'back' button or general emergency exit mechanism in the top bar. While a home screen is often a root, the heuristic applies to the overall system. Users navigating deeper into the app might feel a lack of control if a consistent, clearly marked way to revert actions or go back to a previous state is not readily available.",

        "Overall app navigation",
        "Top navigation bar (lack of back control)"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Ensure a clear and consistent 'back' navigation option is present and easily discoverable when users navigate away from the home screen to deeper content. For multi-step processes or forms, provide 'cancel' options. This fosters a sense of security and control for the user."

      "heuristic_id": 5,
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "severity": "low",
      "issue": "The 'accessibility_observations' note that 'Interactive elements in the top banner like the small arrow or security text might have small tap targets.' Small tap targets increase the likelihood of mis-taps, causing users to accidentally trigger unintended actions or miss their intended target, which is a form of error and can lead to frustration.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Right arrow icon (top banner)",
        "Security text (top banner)"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Increase the tap target size for all interactive elements to meet or exceed recommended guidelines (e.g., 48x48 dp for Android, 44x44 pt for iOS) to minimize accidental taps and improve usability for all users, especially those with motor impairments or in challenging environments."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The 'Home' item in the bottom navigation bar is clearly indicated as the active screen through its distinct black icon and text, providing immediate feedback on the user's current location. Additionally, the 'Free shipping' deal card and 'Lightning deals' section prominently display countdown timers ('Ends in 20 : 26 : 18'), effectively communicating the time-sensitive status of these offers to create urgency and inform the user."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI effectively uses language and concepts familiar to its target users, an e-commerce audience. Terms like 'Free shipping', '30% off On first 3 orders', 'New user gift', 'Lightning deals', and standard navigation labels ('Home', 'Categories', 'Cart') are clear and directly align with user expectations. The icons (e.g., 'Search', 'Checkmark', 'Lightning bolt', bottom navigation icons) are standard and easily recognizable within the context of online shopping, minimizing cognitive load."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The design demonstrates strong consistency. 'Right arrow' icons are uniformly used to indicate navigation to more details or additional content across different sections (e.g., top banner, 'New user gift', 'Lightning deals'). The layout and visual presentation of 'deal_card' and 'product_card' elements are consistent, aiding predictability. The brand's primary orange color is consistently applied to the logo, key promotions, and active elements, reinforcing brand identity. Typography hierarchy, spacing, and the use of a standard bottom navigation bar also adhere to consistent patterns and mobile conventions."
