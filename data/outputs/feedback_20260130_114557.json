      "title": "Enhance System Feedback for User Interactions and Loading States",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users need reassurance that their actions are being processed and content is loading correctly. Lack of feedback can lead to confusion, frustration, repeated actions, and a perception that the app is slow or unresponsive.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Implement distinct visual feedback (e.g., pressed states, ripple effects) for all interactive elements (buttons, icons, cards) upon tap.",
        "Introduce skeleton screens or spinners for content sections that are fetching data (e.g., product carousels, promotional banners) to indicate active loading.",
        "Display brief, transient success messages (e.g., toast notifications) for key user actions like 'Item added to cart', 'Product favorited', or 'Filter applied'."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Add annotations to wireframes illustrating loading states (skeleton UI for dynamic content areas) and example transient success messages (e.g., a toast notification appearing at the bottom of the screen after an action)."

      "title": "Implement Consistent Back Navigation",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users need a clear and consistent way to revert actions or return to previous screens. Without a readily available 'back' mechanism, users can feel lost, trapped, or unable to explore the app without commitment, leading to frustration.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Ensure a clear 'back' arrow icon is present in the top-left corner of the navigation bar on all screens *except* the primary home screen.",
        "Verify that this back button consistently navigates to the immediately preceding view in the user's interaction history (e.g., from a product detail page back to the listing where it was selected)."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "For screens typically reached from the home screen (e.g., Product Detail Pages, Category Listing Pages), add a standard 'back' arrow icon (e.g., '<') to the top-left of their respective navigation headers."

      "title": "Enlarge Tap Targets for Top Banner Interactive Elements",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Small tap targets significantly increase the likelihood of mis-taps, leading to accidental actions or difficulty in interacting with intended elements. This frustrates all users and poses a significant accessibility barrier for those with motor impairments.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Increase the active touch target area for the 'Right arrow' icon in the top banner and the 'Safe payment | Security privacy | Purchase protection' text to a minimum of 44x44 CSS pixels (or platform equivalent).",
        "This can be achieved by adding sufficient padding around the visual element within the component's boundaries, without necessarily making the icon or text itself visually larger."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Annotate the interactive elements within the top banner (the 'Right arrow' icon and the security text) with visual cues indicating an enlarged, invisible tap target area (e.g., a dashed box representing the minimum required size around the element)."

      "id": 4,
      "title": "Reduce Visual Clutter on Home Screen",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "An overly dense screen with numerous competing promotional messages and timers can overwhelm users, making it difficult to quickly identify primary calls to action, focus on specific content, or discern the app's most important offerings.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Evaluate opportunities to consolidate or visually de-emphasize some promotional messages, especially if they are similar or less critical than others (e.g., combine 'Free shipping' and '30% off' if they are both new user incentives).",
        "Introduce slightly more vertical whitespace or clearer visual separation between distinct content sections to improve readability and guide the user's eye.",
        "Prioritize the most impactful promotions visually, allowing secondary offers to be discovered without demanding immediate attention, perhaps by using more subtle styling or grouping."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Suggest layout adjustments such as combining multiple 'deal_card' elements into a single, swipeable carousel, increasing vertical padding between major content blocks, or proposing lighter, less intrusive styling for secondary promotional banners to reduce visual weight."

      "title": "Implement User-Friendly Error Handling",
      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "Without clear, helpful error messages, users will be confused and frustrated when things go wrong. This prevents them from understanding the problem, recovering from errors, and ultimately completing their tasks within the app.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "For network-related failures (e.g., when content cannot load), display an explicit message like 'Connection lost. Please check your internet and try again.' along with a 'Retry' button.",
        "For business logic errors (e.g., a product becoming out of stock after being viewed or added to cart), provide specific, actionable feedback such as 'This item is currently unavailable. We've saved it to your favorites, or you can browse similar products.'",
        "Ensure all error messages are written in plain, empathetic language, avoid technical jargon, and offer clear next steps or solutions."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Include example error state screens or dialogs for common scenarios (e.g., a full-screen network error overlay with a retry button, or an 'out of stock' message integrated into a product card or a checkout flow)."

      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "New users or those encountering difficulties with specific deals, features, or the app's overall functionality will benefit from easily accessible help, FAQs, or contact support options, improving their confidence and reducing frustration.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Confirm that the 'You' section in the bottom navigation bar clearly contains a labeled entry point for 'Help', 'FAQ', 'Customer Service', or 'Contact Us'.",
        "If applicable, consider adding a subtle, contextual help icon (e.g., a small '?' icon) to specific complex or unfamiliar sections within the app, linking directly to relevant support articles or tutorials."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Annotate the destination screen of the 'You' tab to explicitly show a 'Help & Support' or 'FAQs' section. No direct home screen change is immediately required, but ensure visibility within a logical section."

      "title": "Improve Text Contrast for Accessibility",
      "priority": "high",
      "why_it_matters": "Insufficient text contrast makes content unreadable for users with visual impairments, older users, or those viewing the screen in bright conditions. This is a critical accessibility barrier and a direct violation of WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, potentially leading to exclusion and legal non-compliance.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Adjust the color values for all light gray text elements (e.g., strikethrough prices like '$6.99', 'sold' counts like '3 sold', and other secondary information) to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the white background.",
        "Utilize a color contrast checker tool (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker) during development and QA to verify compliance for all relevant text elements."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Update the color specifications (e.g., hex codes) for affected secondary text elements in the design system or style guide to darker shades of gray or black that meet the required contrast ratios."

      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Without appropriate descriptive alternative text, screen reader users cannot understand the content or purpose of product images and other meaningful non-text content. This creates a significant accessibility barrier, preventing them from effectively browsing products or understanding promotions.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Implement programmatic `alt` attributes for all product image components, dynamically populating them with concise, descriptive text (e.g., 'Blue men's shirt', 'Toddler kids' outfit set', 'Black puffer jacket'). The alt text should convey the essential information or function of the image.",
        "Review all other non-text content (e.g., decorative icons, promotional banners that convey information visually) to ensure they either have appropriate alt text or are marked as decorative if they add no informational value."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Annotate all image components on wireframes with a note indicating the requirement for dynamic, descriptive `alt` text. This is primarily a code-level implementation but should be a standard requirement in design documentation."
