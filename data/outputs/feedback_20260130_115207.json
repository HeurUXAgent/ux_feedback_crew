      "why_it_matters": "Small text is difficult for many users to read, especially those with visual impairments or on smaller screens, leading to frustration and reduced comprehension. This directly impacts accessibility and user experience, potentially causing users to abandon tasks or miss critical information.",

      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "A crucial time-sensitive offer like a cart-specific timer needs to be highly visible and actionable to effectively drive urgency and conversions. Lack of visual feedback for the 'GET ALL' button can leave users uncertain if their action registered, potentially leading to repeat taps or confusion.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Increase the size, contrast, and visual weight of the 'countdown_timer' positioned 'above cart icon' to ensure it's easily noticeable.",
        "Implement clear visual feedback (e.g., a momentary color change, subtle animation, or ripple effect) for the 'GET ALL' button when a user interacts with it.",

      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "An excessive number of competing promotional cards and timers can overwhelm users, making it difficult for them to discern the most important offers. This 'choice paralysis' can dilute the impact of each promotion and hinder users from finding relevant deals, leading to a cluttered and frustrating experience.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Review the current hierarchy of 'promotion_card's, 'countdown_timer's, and 'section_header's.",
        "Identify the primary offer that should receive the most visual emphasis and ensure it stands out clearly.",
        "Increase vertical and horizontal whitespace around individual promotional elements to provide better visual separation and reduce the feeling of crowding.",

      "why_it_matters": "Truncated user reviews prevent users from fully accessing and understanding peer feedback, which is a crucial factor in building trust and informing purchase decisions. Forcing users to navigate away or strain to read incomplete text creates unnecessary friction and a poor user experience.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "For all 'user_review_card' components, implement a 'Read More' button or link when the 'text' content exceeds a predefined character limit or number of lines.",
