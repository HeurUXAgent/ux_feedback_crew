## 📝 Detailed Feedback

### 🟠 Refactor post options icon for clarity and control

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** User control and freedom

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users need clear, reversible actions to control their feed and prevent accidental, permanent content removal.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Replace the current 'X' icon in the post header with a '...' (MoreHoriz) icon.
2. Implement a 'showModalBottomSheet' or 'AlertDialog' that appears upon tapping the 'MoreHoriz' icon.
3. Populate the overlay with distinct, labeled actions such as 'Hide post', 'Report post', 'Save post', 'Turn off notifications for this post', etc.
4. When 'Hide post' is selected, remove the post from the feed and display a temporary 'SnackBar' at the bottom of the screen with a message like 'Post hidden' and an 'Undo' action button.
5. The 'Undo' action should re-insert the post into its original position in the feed.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Replace the 'X' icon with a three-dots (ellipsis) icon. Illustrate a modal bottom sheet showing clear, labeled options. Show a snackbar at the bottom of the screen with an 'Undo' button after 'Hide post' is selected.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Use Flutter's `IconButton` with `Icons.more_horiz`, and `showModalBottomSheet` containing `ListTile` widgets for actions. Implement `SnackBar` with an `action` for undo.
```

### 🟠 Ensure 'See More' button is fully visible for truncated posts

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Consistency and standards

#### 💡 Why It Matters
A truncated, cut-off 'See More' button disrupts readability and prevents users from fully engaging with content, impacting accessibility.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Review the layout constraints of the main post text and the 'See More' button within the post card.
2. Ensure the parent container (e.g., `Column` or `Container` with explicit height/padding) provides sufficient vertical space for both the truncated text and the full 'See More' button.
3. Add adequate `padding` (e.g., `EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 4, horizontal: 0)`) to the 'See More' button to prevent it from being clipped or overlapping with surrounding content.
4. Verify `TextOverflow.ellipsis` and `maxLines` are correctly applied to the text component, and the button appears as the next distinct element.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Adjust the post text container and the 'තව' (See More) button so the entire button is clearly visible, with some vertical padding separating it from the main text and any subsequent elements.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
In Flutter, check `Expanded` and `Flexible` usage. Ensure `TextButton` or similar widgets are not being clipped by `overflow` properties or tight parent constraints. Use `SizedBox` for explicit spacing if needed.
```

### 🟡 Add reaction counts and make emoji cluster tappable

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** small | **Heuristic:** Recognition rather than recall

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Explicit reaction counts and clear tappable areas encourage user engagement and provide immediate insight into post popularity.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Fetch real-time reaction counts from the backend API for the displayed post.
2. Render each existing reaction emoji alongside its corresponding numerical count (e.g., '🥺 5', '❤️ 10') within the post-header area.
3. Group these emojis and counts visually (e.g., in a `Row` widget).
4. Wrap this entire reaction display area in a `GestureDetector` or `InkWell` to make it tappable.
5. Implement an `onTap` handler that navigates to a detailed reaction screen (showing who reacted with what) or triggers a reaction picker/list.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show numerical counts next to each reaction emoji (e.g., '🥺 5 ❤️ 10'). Indicate that the combined area of emojis and counts is a tappable interactive element.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
In Flutter, use a `Row` to contain `Text` widgets for emojis and counts. Wrap the `Row` in an `InkWell` to provide visual feedback on tap. Ensure the backend provides reaction count data.
```

### 🟡 Optimize header icons density and spacing

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** small | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Reducing visual clutter in the header improves scannability and lowers cognitive load, making it easier for users to quickly find desired actions.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Increase the horizontal padding or `SizedBox` spacing between the `IconButton` widgets in the top-right header (create post/story, search, Messenger). Aim for a minimum of 16-24dp spacing.
2. Ensure all icons are aligned consistently and have similar visual weight and size (e.g., `IconData` size 24).
3. Verify the `badge` for unread messages is positioned clearly over the Messenger icon without overlapping other icons, and ensure it dynamically adjusts if content changes.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Increase the horizontal space between the 'create post', 'search', and 'Messenger' icons in the top-right header, ensuring comfortable finger tapping space and visual separation. Confirm badges are clearly associated with their respective icons.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
In Flutter, manage spacing within a `Row` using `SizedBox` widgets or by adjusting `padding` on individual `IconButton` components. Ensure badge positioning relative to its parent icon is handled with `Stack` and `Positioned` widgets effectively.
```

### 🟡 Implement loading and success feedback for key actions

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** Visibility of system status

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Clear system status feedback reduces user anxiety, prevents unintended duplicate actions, and confirms that their input has been received and is being processed.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. **For post creation/submission:**
2. When a user initiates a new post (taps 'What's on your mind?' or 'create post' icon), display a `LinearProgressIndicator` or a skeleton screen if loading a complex editor.
3. When the user taps 'Submit' (or similar action) for a new post, replace the button's text with a `CircularProgressIndicator` during the API call, and disable the button.
4. Upon successful submission, display a `SnackBar` with a 'Post created successfully!' message and/or navigate back to the feed where the new post is visible.
5. **For feed content loading:**
6. When the initial feed or 'load more' content is being fetched, display a series of `Shimmer` effects (skeleton loading) for each feed post instead of blank space.
7. For 'load more' scenarios, show a discreet `CircularProgressIndicator` at the bottom of the `ListView` while additional posts are being appended.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Illustrate a spinner on the submit button during post submission, followed by a temporary success snackbar. Show animated skeleton loading for feed posts that are still fetching content. Include a small loading spinner at the bottom of the feed when 'loading more'.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Use Flutter's `FutureBuilder` or state management (e.g., Provider, BLoC) to manage loading states. Implement `CircularProgressIndicator` within `TextButton` or `ElevatedButton`. Utilize `SnackBar` for feedback. Explore libraries like `shimmer` for skeleton loading animations.
```

### 🟢 Remove redundant profile picture from post image

**Priority:** P3 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Eliminating unnecessary visual elements reduces minor cognitive load and improves aesthetic clarity without impacting essential information or functionality.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Locate the `Image` widget responsible for displaying the redundant profile picture within the main post image content area (bottom-right position).
2. Remove this specific `Image` widget and any associated layout (e.g., `Positioned` within a `Stack`) that places it on top of the main post image.
3. Verify that the post author's profile picture and name in the post header remain clearly visible and accurately identify the author.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Remove the small profile picture overlay located in the bottom-right corner of the main post image. The author's information in the post header is sufficient.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
In Flutter, identify the `CircleAvatar` or `Image.network` widget usually nested within a `Stack` or `Align` widget relative to the main post `Image` and delete it.
```
