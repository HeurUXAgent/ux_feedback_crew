## Feedback Items

### 🟡 Implement Loading States for Dynamic Content

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Users may perceive the app as slow or unresponsive if content like artist profile images, album art, or song lists appear with a delay without feedback. Explicit loading indicators manage user expectations and reduce frustration during network requests.

**What to do:**
- For the artist profile picture, implement a circular placeholder (skeleton) that shows while the image loads.
- For 'Latest Release' and 'Top Songs' sections, display skeleton loaders for the album art and text lines for song titles and details until the actual content is fetched and rendered.
- Consider a subtle progress indicator if any specific content block takes a longer-than-usual time to load.

**Wireframe changes:** Add gray placeholder shapes (circles for profile picture, rectangles for album art) and placeholder text lines in areas where dynamic content is expected to load.

### 🟡 Add Visual Feedback for Button Interactions

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Users need immediate confirmation that their tap or click has been registered. Without instant feedback, users might question if their action was successful, leading to repeated taps, confusion, or the perception that the app is unresponsive.

**What to do:**
- Implement a subtle visual state change (e.g., brief highlight, ripple effect, or slight color tint change) upon tap for all interactive icon buttons (Back, Heart/Like, Share/Export, Play, Pause, Thumbs down/up, Ellipsis menu).
- For state-changing actions like 'Heart/Like' or 'Thumbs Up/Down', consider a temporary visual animation (e.g., icon fill, brief sparkle) or a quick state change to confirm the action's success.

**Wireframe changes:** Annotate interactive elements with expected states (e.g., 'On Tap: Brief highlight/color change') to indicate desired visual feedback.

### 🟡 Standardize Text Casing for Headings and Labels

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Inconsistent text casing across different headings and labels (e.g., 'Millions of Free Songs' vs. 'BIO' vs. 'Two Birds, One Stone') detracts from the app's professional appearance and can make scanning and information processing less efficient for users.

**What to do:**
- Establish a clear and consistent text casing standard for all headings, subheadings, and key labels throughout the application (e.g., Title Case for main titles, ALL CAPS for section headers, Sentence case for body/details).
- Apply the chosen standard uniformly. For example, change 'BIO', 'LATEST RELEASE', and 'TOP SONGS' to Title Case (e.g., 'Bio', 'Latest Release', 'Top Songs') to align with other labels like 'Millions of Free Songs' and song titles.

**Wireframe changes:** Update text casing in relevant label components (e.g., 'BIO' to 'Bio', 'LATEST RELEASE' to 'Latest Release', 'TOP SONGS' to 'Top Songs').

### 🟢 Enlarge Tap Target for Ellipsis Menu Icons

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Small tap targets, as noted for the 'Ellipsis menu' icons, increase the likelihood of mis-taps, leading to user frustration. This also negatively impacts accessibility, especially for users with motor impairments or those using larger fingers.

**What to do:**
- Increase the effective touch target area for all 'Ellipsis menu' icons to a minimum of 44x44 points/pixels. This can be achieved by expanding the tappable region around the icon without necessarily making the icon itself visually larger.

**Wireframe changes:** Annotate the ellipsis icon buttons with a larger invisible hit area or padding to denote the expanded tap target.
