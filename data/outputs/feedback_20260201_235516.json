      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users need immediate feedback to understand if their actions (like initiating a search or applying a filter) have been registered and if content is loading. Lack of system status can lead to uncertainty, repeated actions, or the perception that the application is unresponsive or broken, especially during network operations.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Display a loading indicator (e.g., a skeleton screen or shimmer effect) when fetching content for sections like 'Popular near you' to indicate that data is being loaded.",
        "Provide explicit feedback for user interactions such as search initiation (e.g., a brief spinner in the search bar or a subtle toast message) to confirm the action.",
        "Design a specific 'no results' state for search or filter outcomes to clearly inform the user when no matching content is found."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Show placeholder rectangles for images and text within content cards during initial loading. Add a small, temporary spinner animation within or next to the search input field when a search query is active. Design a dedicated UI for 'no results' found, including a descriptive message and potential next steps."

      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "Typographical errors diminish the app's professionalism and can create minor friction or confusion for users. Ambiguous icons (like the 'Distance/Wind Icon') force users to interpret their meaning, which increases cognitive load and can lead to misinterpretation of important information, such as distance.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Correct the spelling of 'destnation' to 'destination' in the search input field's placeholder text.",
        "Correct the spelling of 'Montain' to 'Mountain' on the category filter button.",
        "Replace the 'Distance/Wind Icon' with a universally recognized symbol for distance (e.g., a ruler, a walking person icon, or a generic location marker with an arrow) to avoid ambiguity when paired with '14km'."

      "wireframe_changes": "Update the text string within the 'Search destination, ...' input field. Update the text string on the 'Mountain' category button. Replace the existing icon next to the '14km' label in the content cards with a more appropriate distance-related icon."

      "title": "Add a 'clear search' button to the input field",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users require a quick and easy way to clear their search queries. Relying on manual deletion or keyboard controls is less efficient and can interrupt the user's flow, hindering their ability to quickly modify or restart a search.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Implement a clear 'X' or 'cancel' icon within the 'Search destnation, ...' input field.",
        "Ensure this 'clear' icon becomes visible only when text has been entered into the search field.",
        "When tapped, the 'clear' icon should instantly remove all text from the input field and revert the search results or suggestions to their default state."

      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "Inconsistent text casing (e.g., 'Annie January' in Title Case and 'Basic account' in Sentence case) creates a lack of visual cohesion. Consistent application of typography standards makes the interface appear more polished, professional, and trustworthy.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Establish a clear text casing standard for all labels and headings within the user profile header.",

      "why_it_matters": "Without proactive input validation and helpful suggestions, users are likely to enter invalid or misspelled terms. This leads to frustrating 'no results' pages or incorrect functionality, wasting user effort and creating a poor experience rather than preventing errors from occurring.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Integrate an autocomplete or auto-suggestion feature for the 'Jombang, IDN' location input, offering valid geographical options as the user types.",

        "Display clear, immediate inline feedback or hints if the user enters an invalid, incomplete, or unrecognized term, guiding them towards a valid input."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Design a dropdown UI that appears below the location and search input fields to display autocomplete suggestions. Define how inline error messages or validation cues will appear (e.g., red border, warning icon, explanatory text) for invalid input."
