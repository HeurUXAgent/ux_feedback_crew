      "issue": "The UI description does not indicate the presence of explicit loading indicators (e.g., spinners, skeleton screens) when dynamic content, such as the artist profile picture, album art, or song lists, is being fetched or updated. Users might experience uncertainty or perceive the app as slow if content appears with a delay without feedback.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "Implement visual loading states, such as skeleton screens for content blocks or progress indicators, to inform users that data is being loaded. This reassures users and manages their expectations during network requests."

      "issue": "There's no mention of immediate visual feedback when users interact with clickable elements such as 'Heart/Like', 'Share/Export', 'Play', 'Pause', 'Thumbs down', or 'Thumbs up' buttons. Without instant feedback, users might question if their action was registered.",

      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "severity": "medium",
      "issue": "The text casing is inconsistent across different labels and headings within the UI. For example, 'Millions of Free Songs' uses Title Case, while 'BIO', 'LATEST RELEASE', and 'TOP SONGS' use ALL CAPS, and song titles are Title Case. This can detract from the app's professional appearance and make scanning less efficient.",

        "label"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Establish a clear and consistent text casing standard for all headings, subheadings, and labels throughout the application. For instance, decide whether primary headings should always be Title Case or ALL CAPS, and apply it uniformly."

      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "severity": "low",
      "issue": "The 'Ellipsis menu' icons are described as 'small' and potentially 'challenging for precise tapping' in the accessibility observations. While standard, their small size can lead to accidental mis-taps or frustration, particularly for users with motor impairments, and deviates from the generally comfortable tap targets elsewhere.",
      "affected_components": [
        "icon_button"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Increase the effective touch target area for the 'Ellipsis menu' icons. This can be achieved by expanding the tappable region around the icon without necessarily making the icon itself visually larger, improving usability and accessibility."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The presence of a standard status bar at the top (with Verizon, WiFi signal, time, and battery percentage) effectively keeps users informed about critical system-level statuses."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI employs highly recognizable and standard icons (Back, Heart/Like, Share, Play, Ellipsis menu, Thumbs Up/Down) and uses clear, user-friendly language ('LATEST RELEASE', 'TOP SONGS', artist/song names) that aligns well with the mental model of a music streaming application. It also adheres to common iOS platform conventions."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "observation": "The inclusion of a prominent 'Back' button in the top-left corner provides a clear and easily accessible 'emergency exit' from the current screen. Furthermore, the persistent mini-player at the bottom offers users continuous control over their music playback, allowing them to browse freely without interrupting their listening experience."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The overall layout, particularly the list-based organization of content with consistent row structures (album art, title, details, ellipsis menu), maintains predictability. The consistent placement of navigation elements and actions (e.g., top-left back button, top-right utility actions) adheres to established mobile UI patterns."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "observation": "The primary 'Play' button for the artist profile is large, prominently colored, and has a clear tap target, significantly reducing the chance of accidental mis-taps for this crucial action. The screen primarily focuses on content consumption, with no immediately visible destructive actions."
