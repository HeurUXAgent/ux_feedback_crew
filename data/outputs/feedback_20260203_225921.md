## 📝 Detailed Feedback

### 🟠 Replace 'X' icon with 'More Options' and Add Undo for 'Hide Post'

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** User control and freedom

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users might accidentally hide content permanently, leading to frustration and perceived lack of control over their feed.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Replace the current 'X' icon component (e.g., `IconButton` in Flutter, `Button` with SVG in React Native) with a '...' (ellipsis/kebab menu) icon.
2. Implement a modal bottom sheet or dropdown menu that appears upon tapping the '...' icon.
3. Populate this menu with clear, labeled options such as 'Hide post', 'Report post', 'Save post'.
4. When 'Hide post' is selected, trigger the appropriate API call to hide the content and immediately display a temporary `Snackbar` or `Toast` message at the bottom of the screen with an 'Undo' action.
5. If 'Undo' is tapped, revert the API call (if applicable) and re-display the post. Ensure the undo mechanism is robust for network latency.
6. The 'Undo' notification should be visible for a reasonable duration (e.g., 5-7 seconds) before disappearing.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show '...' icon replacing 'X' in the post header. Illustrate the 'More Options' menu opening on tap. Show a temporary 'Snackbar' at the bottom of the screen reading 'Post hidden. Undo' after a post is hidden.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, use `PopupMenuButton` or `showModalBottomSheet` for the menu, and `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar()` for the 'Undo' toast. Ensure backend API supports 'hide' and 'unhide' actions.
```

### 🟠 Ensure Full Visibility of 'See More' Button in Feed Posts

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Consistency and standards

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users may struggle to read the full post or interact with the 'See More' button, leading to a fragmented content experience and potential accessibility issues.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Review the layout container (e.g., `Column`, `Flex`) wrapping the post text and the 'See More' button.
2. Increase the vertical `padding` or `margin` below the truncated text and around the 'See More' button to prevent clipping.
3. Verify `maxLines` property of the text widget and ensure it's not truncating too aggressively or without enough buffer for the button.
4. Test across various device screen sizes and text scaling settings to ensure responsive display and prevent future truncation issues.
5. Ensure the 'See More' button's touch target is at least 48x48dp, even if its visual size is smaller.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the main post text block with the 'See More' button ('තව') fully visible and clearly separated from the bottom edge of the post card and the text itself, with ample whitespace.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Adjust `Padding` or `SizedBox` in Flutter. For web/React Native, check CSS `padding`, `margin`, `min-height` on the containing elements. Avoid using `overflow: hidden` on the container if it's contributing to clipping.
```

### 🟡 Add Reaction Counts and Tappable Area to Post Emojis

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** Recognition rather than recall

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users might miss opportunities to engage with posts or misunderstand the purpose of the displayed emojis, relying on recall rather than clear visual cues.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Modify the backend API endpoint for feed posts to include aggregated counts for each reaction type (e.g., `{'🥺': 5, '❤️': 10}`).
2. On the frontend, fetch and display these numerical counts immediately adjacent to their corresponding emoji (e.g., '🥺 5', '❤️ 10').
3. Wrap the entire reaction display area (emojis + counts) in a `GestureDetector` (Flutter) or similar tappable component.
4. Implement a navigation action on tap: either open a bottom sheet/modal displaying users who reacted, or display a reaction picker for the current user to add/change their reaction.
5. Ensure the combined tappable area meets minimum touch target guidelines (e.g., 48x48dp).

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show numerical counts next to each reaction emoji (e.g., '🥺 5', '❤️ 10'). Indicate that this entire area is interactive and leads to a reaction details view or picker.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Requires backend modification. Frontend will use `Text` widgets for counts and `InkWell` or `GestureDetector` for interaction. Consider `ModalBottomSheet` for reaction details.
```

### 🟡 Optimize Spacing and Visual Weight in Top-Right Header Icons

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users might feel overwhelmed by the number of interactive elements, potentially increasing cognitive load and hindering quick scanning for specific actions.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Increase the horizontal `padding` or `margin` between the 'Create post/story', 'Search', and 'Messenger' icons in the top-right header.
2. Ensure the Messenger notification badge is clearly associated with its icon but does not cause visual overlap or interfere with the icon's touch target.
3. Verify that all header icons maintain a minimum touch target size of 48x48dp.
4. Review icon design: consider using outline icons for less critical actions to reduce visual weight, while maintaining clarity and platform conventions.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the top-right header icons ('Create', 'Search', 'Messenger') with more generous and consistent horizontal spacing between them. Ensure the Messenger badge is distinct and doesn't clutter the icon.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Adjust `SizedBox` widths or `Padding` in Flutter/React Native. For web, use CSS `gap` or `margin` properties within a Flexbox container for the icons. Ensure icon assets are consistent in style.
```

### 🟡 Implement Loading Indicators for Post Creation and Feed Scrolling

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** Visibility of system status

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users may experience anxiety or uncertainty, wonder if their input was received, or mistakenly perform actions multiple times due to a lack of system feedback.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. **For Post Creation (from 'What's on your mind?' and 'create post/story' icon):**
2. When post creation is initiated (e.g., tapping the 'What's on your mind?' text input or the 'create post/story' icon), display a skeleton screen or a clear loading state for the post creation modal/screen.
3. When the 'Post'/'Share' button within the creation flow is tapped, disable the button and replace its text with a `CircularProgressIndicator` or similar spinner.
4. Upon successful post submission, display a temporary `Snackbar` or `Toast` message (e.g., 'Post shared successfully!').
5. **For Feed Loading (e.g., 'load more' content):**
6. When a user scrolls to the end of the feed and more content is being fetched, display a small `LinearProgressIndicator` at the bottom of the feed or a subtle spinner icon in the center indicating content is loading.
7. Consider implementing skeleton loading for newly fetched feed items as they populate the screen, providing a smoother perceived performance.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show a loading spinner on the 'Post' button during submission. Show a 'Post shared!' `Snackbar` on success. Illustrate a small loading indicator at the bottom of the feed when scrolling to load more content.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Requires robust state management (e.g., BLoC, Provider in Flutter; Redux, Context API in React Native) to track loading states. Use `CircularProgressIndicator`, `LinearProgressIndicator`, or custom skeleton widgets. `ScaffoldMessenger` for SnackBar feedback.
```

### 🟢 Remove Redundant Profile Picture from Post Image Overlay

**Priority:** P3 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
This adds minor visual clutter and unnecessary repetition, which can slightly detract from the overall clean aesthetic and potentially confuse screen reader users.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Identify the UI component (e.g., `Image` widget, `<img>` tag with absolute positioning) that renders the small profile picture in the bottom-right corner of the main post image.
2. Remove this component from the post's layout.
3. Verify that the post author's identity is still clearly and sufficiently communicated by their profile picture and name in the post header area.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the main post image content without the small, overlaid profile picture in its bottom-right corner. The post header should still clearly display the author's profile picture and name.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
This should be a straightforward removal of a single UI element. Ensure no side effects are introduced, like layout shifts or broken references.
```
