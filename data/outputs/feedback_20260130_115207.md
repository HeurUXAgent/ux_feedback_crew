## Feedback Items

### 🔴 Ensure all text elements meet minimum readability standards

**Priority:** HIGH

**Why it matters:** Small text is difficult for many users to read, especially those with visual impairments or on smaller screens, leading to frustration and reduced comprehension. This directly impacts accessibility and user experience, potentially causing users to abandon tasks or miss critical information.

**What to do:**
- Review all 'countdown_timer' components (e.g., '20 : 26 : 18'), 'product_thumbnail' price and sold text (e.g., '$0.90 $6.99', '3 sold'), 'label' components (e.g., 'On first 3 orders'), and 'security_bar' text ('Safe payment | Security privacy | Purchase protection').
- Increase their font sizes to a minimum of 12sp (standard for mobile readability).
- Verify readability across various mobile devices and screen sizes to ensure legibility for all users.

**Wireframe changes:** Enlarge font size for the specified text elements. Adjust surrounding component sizes or spacing if needed to accommodate larger text.

### 🟡 Enhance visibility and interactivity of cart-specific countdown and 'GET ALL' button

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** A crucial time-sensitive offer like a cart-specific timer needs to be highly visible and actionable to effectively drive urgency and conversions. Lack of visual feedback for the 'GET ALL' button can leave users uncertain if their action registered, potentially leading to repeat taps or confusion.

**What to do:**
- Increase the size, contrast, and visual weight of the 'countdown_timer' positioned 'above cart icon' to ensure it's easily noticeable.
- Implement clear visual feedback (e.g., a momentary color change, subtle animation, or ripple effect) for the 'GET ALL' button when a user interacts with it.
- Ensure the cart-specific timer's text also adheres to the minimum 12sp font size for readability.

**Wireframe changes:** Enlarge and potentially bold/highlight the cart countdown timer. Add visual states (e.g., `:active`, `:hover` if applicable) for the 'GET ALL' button.

### 🟡 Reduce visual clutter by prioritizing promotional elements and increasing whitespace

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** An excessive number of competing promotional cards and timers can overwhelm users, making it difficult for them to discern the most important offers. This 'choice paralysis' can dilute the impact of each promotion and hinder users from finding relevant deals, leading to a cluttered and frustrating experience.

**What to do:**
- Review the current hierarchy of 'promotion_card's, 'countdown_timer's, and 'section_header's.
- Identify the primary offer that should receive the most visual emphasis and ensure it stands out clearly.
- Increase vertical and horizontal whitespace around individual promotional elements to provide better visual separation and reduce the feeling of crowding.
- Consider alternative display methods for secondary promotions, such as grouping related items into a single collapsible section or utilizing a carousel for less prominent offers.

**Wireframe changes:** Adjust padding and margins around promotional cards, timers, and section headers. Potentially redesign the layout of promotional blocks to emphasize one main offer, perhaps by making it larger or giving it a more unique background.

### 🟢 Allow users to easily expand truncated review text in-place

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Truncated user reviews prevent users from fully accessing and understanding peer feedback, which is a crucial factor in building trust and informing purchase decisions. Forcing users to navigate away or strain to read incomplete text creates unnecessary friction and a poor user experience.

**What to do:**
- For all 'user_review_card' components, implement a 'Read More' button or link when the 'text' content exceeds a predefined character limit or number of lines.
- Ensure that clicking 'Read More' expands the full review text directly within the existing 'user_review_card' without navigating to a new screen or modal.
- Optionally, provide a 'Show Less' or 'Collapse' option once the review has been expanded.

**Wireframe changes:** Add a 'Read More' link/button at the end of truncated review text within the 'user_review_card'. When active, display the full text.
