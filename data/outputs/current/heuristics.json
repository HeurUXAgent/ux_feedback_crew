Some icons are black outlines ('Redeem', 'Rate Us'), while others are illustrative and multi-colored ('MATHS', 'GK', 'SCIENCE' icons), and some are single-color functional icons with specific colors ('Money bag' in yellow, '27' in red).

      "issue": "The extensive use of various strong gradient backgrounds (purple-pink, blue-light blue, red-orange for cards, plus a dark blue/purple system wallpaper gradient) on a single screen might make the UI feel visually busy rather than minimalist.

  "overall_score": 7.0,
  "summary": "This mobile UI for 'Quiz Pool' presents a visually engaging and well-structured dashboard. It scores highly on clarity, consistency in layout, and the intuitive recognition of actions and content, largely thanks to its card-based design, clear labeling, and recognizable icons. The large tap targets are a significant strength for overall usability and accessibility. However, the UI has notable shortcomings, particularly in feedback mechanisms, which can leave users uncertain about system status. While colorful, the combination of multiple strong gradients and inconsistent icon styling slightly diminishes its minimalist aesthetic. More critically, the stated lack of dynamic text scaling support and unaddressed keyboard focus management are serious accessibility barriers that would prevent users with visual or motor impairments from effectively using the application, significantly impacting WCAG compliance and the overall UX score. Addressing these accessibility gaps and refining visual feedback would elevate the user experience considerably."
