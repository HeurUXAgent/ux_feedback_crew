  "overall_score": 8.5,
  "summary": "This mobile UI demonstrates a strong adherence to Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, particularly excelling in consistency, recognition over recall, and aesthetic design. The use of familiar language, recognizable icons, and a clear visual hierarchy makes the app intuitive and easy to navigate for discovering travel destinations. Active states for interactive elements keep users informed of their current position and selections. While the screen doesn't explicitly show mechanisms for error prevention or recovery, this is common for a static home/discovery view. Minor areas for improvement include explicitly showing loading states for dynamic content and ensuring help documentation is easily accessible within the application. Overall, it's a well-designed interface that prioritizes user experience for its intended purpose."
