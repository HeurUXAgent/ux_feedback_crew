  "overall_score": 7.5,
  "summary": "The UI for the Hotel Reservation form demonstrates strong adherence to principles of aesthetic design and consistency, providing a visually coherent and easy-to-understand layout with clear labels and standard iconography. It excels in minimizing user recall by making options and information readily visible. However, critical usability gaps exist in the areas of system status visibility, error prevention, and especially in helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. The absence of explicit feedback for validation, submission, and error handling significantly impacts the form's robustness and user experience. Minor issues include a lack of features for expert user efficiency and no apparent help documentation. Additionally, the 'accessibility_observations' noted a potential contrast issue with placeholder text, which could affect legibility for some users. Addressing the feedback and error management aspects would substantially improve the overall usability and user satisfaction of this application."
