      "why_it_matters": "Users with low vision or cognitive disabilities will be unable to use the app effectively if they cannot adjust text sizes via their system settings. This violates WCAG 2.1 guidelines (1.4.4 Resize text / 1.4.10 Reflow) and makes the app inaccessible to a significant user group.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Implement support for dynamic text scaling using platform-specific APIs (e.g., `adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth` in iOS, `AutoSizeTextType` in Android).",
        "Test the application with various system font sizes to ensure text reflows correctly and the layout remains usable.",

      "effort_estimate": "Medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users relying on keyboard navigation, screen readers, or switch access require clear focus indicators to navigate the interface. Lack of keyboard support and focus indicators violates WCAG 2.1 guidelines (2.4.3 Focus Order / 2.4.7 Focus Visible) and makes the app unusable for these users.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Ensure all interactive elements (Hamburger menu, Money bag, Redeem card, Rate Us card, Category Cards, System Navigation Bar) are focusable using the tab key or equivalent.",
        "Define a logical tab order for elements, typically following a left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow.",
        "Implement clear and consistent visual focus indicators (e.g., a distinct border or highlight) when an element is focused.",

        "Add a subtle visual feedback effect when users tap on interactive elements.",
        "Consider using a brief color change, a ripple effect, or a slight scaling animation.",
