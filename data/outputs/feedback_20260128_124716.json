      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users might feel uncertain if their actions are registered or if content is loading, leading to frustration, potential repeat actions, and a perception of a slow or unresponsive application. This reduces perceived responsiveness and user control.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "For content areas (e.g., product listings, review carousels) that fetch data, display skeleton loading screens or content placeholders until the actual content is ready.",
        "For individual interactive elements (e.g., product cards, promo cards, navigation bar items), implement subtle visual feedback on tap (e.g., a ripple effect, a slight background color change, or a brief opacity change) to immediately confirm user interaction.",
        "Ensure the active/selected state for elements within the bottom navigation bar is clearly distinct and persistent."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Add wireframe mockups showing skeleton loaders for content carousels/lists. Annotate interactive elements to indicate visual feedback states (e.g., a highlight on tap, a selected navigation tab with a different color/underline)."

      "title": "Enhance text legibility and contrast for accessibility compliance",
      "priority": "high",
      "why_it_matters": "Small text and insufficient contrast ratios make the app difficult or impossible to read for users with visual impairments, older adults, or those in challenging viewing conditions (e.g., bright sunlight). This directly violates fundamental accessibility standards (WCAG AA), leading to an inaccessible and frustrating experience for a significant portion of the user base.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Increase the font size of all small body text, price labels, and informational text (e.g., 'X sold', 'security privacy', 'Ends in X') to a minimum of 12-16px, or ensure dynamic type scaling is properly supported for accessibility settings.",
        "Adjust the color of light gray text on white backgrounds (e.g., for '3 sold', '56 sold' and details within informational banners) to meet a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1, as per WCAG AA guidelines."

      "title": "Expand tap target sizes for all interactive elements",
      "priority": "high",
      "why_it_matters": "Small tap targets significantly increase the likelihood of users making errors, such as accidentally tapping the wrong product or element, especially for users with motor impairments or larger fingers. This leads to frustration, inefficient navigation, and an overall poor user experience, as it directly hinders error prevention.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "For all interactive elements, including individual product cards/listings, numerical timer segments, and navigation bar items, ensure their effective tappable area (hitbox) is expanded to meet mobile platform guidelines (e.g., minimum 44x44 dp/pt on iOS, 48x48 dp on Android).",
        "Achieve this by adding sufficient invisible padding or increasing the touchable area around the visual element without necessarily altering its displayed size."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Annotate wireframes to clearly indicate the intended expanded hitbox dimensions for specific small interactive components (e.g., individual product cards in a listing, timer number blocks, navigation bar icons)."
