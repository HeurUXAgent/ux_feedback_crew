      "issue": "The description lacks explicit mention of common system feedback mechanisms such as loading indicators for content fetching (e.g., when scrolling through carousels or loading new sections) or clear active states for all interactive elements. While some timers and progress bars exist, general user actions might not receive immediate feedback.",
      "affected_components": [],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Implement clear loading indicators (e.g., skeleton screens, spin-loaders) for content that takes time to fetch. Ensure interactive elements like product cards, buttons, and navigation bar items have distinct pressed or active states."

      "heuristic_id": 4,
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "severity": "high",
      "issue": "The UI description notes several accessibility concerns that directly relate to consistency with widely accepted design and accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG). Specifically, body text and price labels being very small, and insufficient contrast ratios for light gray text on a white background, deviate from common legibility and accessibility guidelines.",

      "heuristic_id": 5,
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "severity": "high",
      "issue": "The accessibility observations explicitly state that 'Tap targets for smaller elements... might be too small for comfortable interaction, especially for users with motor impairments.' Small tap targets significantly increase the likelihood of users making errors, such as accidentally tapping the wrong product or element, leading to frustration and inefficient navigation.",
      "affected_components": [
        "product_listing",
        "timer"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "Increase the size of tap targets for all interactive elements to meet mobile platform guidelines (e.g., minimum 44x44 dp on iOS, 48x48 dp on Android), even if the visual element itself is smaller. Add sufficient padding around small clickable items to ensure comfortable interaction."

      "observation": "The presence of countdown timers ('Ends in 20:26:18') for deals and a 'green progress bar' within the 'Cart | Free shipping' navigation item effectively informs users about the status of promotions and shipping thresholds, creating transparency and urgency."

      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI consistently uses clear, familiar language and widely recognized e-commerce patterns. Terms like 'Free shipping,' '30% off,' 'New user gift,' 'Lightning deals,' and 'X sold' are standard. Icons like 'Search' and navigation labels ('Home', 'Categories', 'Cart', 'You') are intuitive and align with user expectations in shopping apps."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "observation": "The persistent bottom navigation bar ('Home', 'Categories', 'You', 'Cart') provides users with an 'emergency exit' to easily switch between major sections of the app at any time, allowing them to reverse navigational paths or quickly access core functionalities. The '>' symbol for sections like 'New user gift' and 'Lightning deals' clearly indicates interactive elements that lead to more content."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The UI demonstrates strong internal consistency in its layout, color scheme, and use of patterns. It employs a standard mobile structure with a fixed header, scrollable content, and fixed bottom navigation. The color palette is used consistently to brand and highlight promotions, and the typographic hierarchy effectively distinguishes different types of information. Horizontal carousels and strikethrough pricing are consistently used patterns."
