      "why_it_matters": "Users need immediate feedback to confirm their actions are registered and that the system is processing their request. Without visible loading states, users may become uncertain, frustrated, or assume the app is unresponsive, leading to repeated actions or abandonment.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "When fetching content for sections like 'Popular near you,' display skeleton screens (placeholder shapes mimicking the content structure) or subtle spinners until the actual destination cards (e.g., 'Bromo Tengger Semeru Landscape', 'Gunung Andong Magelang Landscape') are loaded.",
        "Provide visual feedback for search initiation: when a user types into 'Search destination, ...' and performs a search, show a temporary spinner within the input field or disable the search button until results are displayed.",
        "If a search yields no results, clearly communicate this with a 'No results found' message rather than an empty screen."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "Introduce skeleton loader components for the large image cards and text overlays in the 'Popular near you' section. Add a conditional small spinner icon within the 'Search destination' text input field. Design a 'No results' state UI for search."

      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "Typos detract from the app's professionalism and can cause minor confusion. Ambiguous icons violate the principle of matching real-world conventions, forcing users to guess their meaning and reducing intuitiveness.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Change the placeholder text in the search input from 'Search destnation, ...' to 'Search destination, ...'.",
        "Correct the 'Montain' category button text to 'Mountain'.",
        "Replace the 'Distance/Wind Icon' with a more universally understood symbol for distance (e.g., a ruler, a walking person, or a simple arrow indicating distance/travel) to eliminate ambiguity."

      "title": "Add a clear/cancel button to the search input field",
      "priority": "medium",
      "why_it_matters": "Users should have effortless control over their input. Lacking a dedicated clear button for the search field means users must manually delete text or rely on system-level controls, which is less efficient and reduces their sense of control.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Implement a small 'X' or 'Clear' icon within the 'Search destination, ...' text input field.",
        "This icon should become visible only when text has been entered into the field.",
        "Tapping the icon must immediately clear the input field's content, allowing users to quickly start a new search."

      "wireframe_changes": "Add a conditionally visible small 'X' icon (e.g., dark gray color, small size) on the right side inside the 'Search destnation, ...' text input, next to the 'Search Magnifying Glass' icon."

      "priority": "low",
      "why_it_matters": "Inconsistent text casing, even for minor labels, can make an interface appear less polished and professional. Adhering to a consistent style guide improves visual harmony and strengthens the overall brand perception.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "Establish a clear text casing standard for all labels and headings throughout the app (e.g., 'Sentence case' for descriptive labels, 'Title Case' for proper nouns and main headings).",
        "Apply the chosen standard consistently. For instance, if 'Sentence case' is preferred for descriptive labels, ensure 'Basic account' remains as is, and document the exception for proper nouns like 'Annie January'."
      ],
      "wireframe_changes": "No direct wireframe change if 'Basic account' remains sentence case and 'Annie January' remains title case (as is common for proper nouns vs. descriptive phrases). However, document the specific text casing rule in the style guide."

      "why_it_matters": "Without proactive error prevention, users may input invalid or misspelled terms, leading to 'no results' screens, incorrect functionality, and increased frustration. Providing real-time feedback and suggestions guides users toward correct input and prevents errors before submission.",
      "what_to_do": [
        "For the 'Jombang, IDN' location input field, integrate an autocomplete feature that suggests valid geographical locations as the user types.",

        "If input is invalid or incomplete (e.g., malformed location, unsupported search term), provide immediate inline feedback (e.g., a red border around the input field, a small error message below it) rather than waiting for submission."
