      "issue": "The provided UI description does not explicitly mention loading indicators for network requests (e.g., when fetching new products or deals) or explicit feedback for user actions (e.g., a visual confirmation after tapping 'GET ALL' or adding an item to the cart). Users might be left wondering if an action registered successfully or if content is still loading, potentially leading to frustration or repeated actions.",

Provide clear, concise feedback (e.g., toast messages, brief animations, haptic feedback) for user interactions like tapping buttons or adding items, informing them that their action was recognized and processed."

      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "severity": "medium",
      "issue": "There is an inconsistency in the legibility and tappability of crucial small text elements, specifically highlighted by the accessibility observations. Countdown timers and 'X sold' labels are described as 'small' or 'very small,' potentially having low readability and being difficult to perceive or tap, especially for users with visual impairments or motor difficulties. This violates the standard of providing consistently clear and accessible information.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "Ensure a minimum legible font size for all functional and important informational text, such as countdown timers and sales indicators, that adheres to accessibility guidelines. Increase the tap target size for any interactive elements, regardless of their visual size, to make them easier to activate."

  "strengths": [
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The presence of multiple `countdown_timer` components (e.g., for general promotions and 'Lightning deals') effectively informs users about the time remaining for limited offers. The bottom navigation also likely indicates the currently active screen ('Home')."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI uses clear, user-friendly language and widely understood e-commerce concepts. Phrases like 'Safe payment,' 'Free shipping,' '30% off,' 'New user gift,' 'Lightning deals,' 'X sold,' and 'User Review Card' directly align with real-world shopping experiences and user expectations. Standard navigation labels ('Home', 'Categories', 'You', 'Cart') also contribute to a strong match."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "observation": "The fixed `bottom_navigation_item`s ('Home', 'Categories', 'You', 'Cart') provide clear and consistent global navigation, allowing users to easily move between major sections of the app. This provides a clear 'emergency exit' from any current context back to a primary section, giving users a strong sense of control and freedom."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The app demonstrates strong consistency in its overall layout and use of established e-commerce patterns, including a persistent header, fixed bottom navigation bar, horizontal carousels for products, and dedicated promotional cards. The consistent use of brand colors (orange) for primary branding and action elements also enhances visual consistency."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "observation": "As a home screen primarily focused on browsing and discovery, there are no immediately apparent 'error-prone' actions (like complex form submissions or destructive deletions) that would require explicit error prevention mechanisms. The UI design for this screen avoids common pitfalls by not presenting opportunities for such errors."
