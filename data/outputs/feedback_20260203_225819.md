## 📝 Detailed Feedback

### 🟠 Clarify 'X' icon functionality in post header or replace with 'More Options'

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** User control and freedom

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users may accidentally hide content permanently, leading to frustration and perceived lack of control over their feed.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Replace the current 'X' (close/hide) icon with a standard '...' (ellipsis) icon to signify 'More Options' for the post.
2. On tap, display a modal bottom sheet (for mobile apps like Flutter/React Native) or a context menu/popover (for web) containing clearly labeled actions such as 'Hide Post', 'Report Post', 'Save Post', 'Turn on notifications for this post', etc.
3. If 'Hide Post' is selected, trigger the hide action and immediately display a temporary `Snackbar` (Android/Flutter) or `Toast` (iOS/Web) at the bottom of the screen with a clear 'Post hidden. [Undo]' message, visible for approximately 5 seconds.
4. Implement the 'Undo' functionality within the `Snackbar`/`Toast` to revert the hide action if tapped by the user within the timeout period.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the '...' icon in the post header. Then, illustrate a modal bottom sheet (mobile) or popover (web) appearing on tap, listing several action options. Also, depict a `Snackbar` message with an 'Undo' button after a post has been hidden.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, consider `showModalBottomSheet` or `showDialog` for the options menu. Use `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar` for the undo toast. For web, utilize a custom dropdown component or a library's Popover and manage the toast's visibility and undo logic with JavaScript.
```

### 🟠 Ensure 'See More' button is fully visible and tappable

**Priority:** P1 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Consistency and standards

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users struggle to fully read post content or interact with the 'See More' button, leading to a fragmented content experience and potential accessibility issues.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Adjust the layout constraints (e.g., parent container width, `maxLines` for text) to guarantee sufficient horizontal space for the entire 'See More' button ('તવ').
2. Verify that the button is not clipped or partially obscured across different screen sizes, orientations, and system font scales.
3. Ensure adequate padding around the `TextButton` or equivalent component to maintain a minimum touch target of 48x48dp, even if the visual text is smaller, to prevent mis-taps.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Depict the main post text truncated with the 'See More' button ('તવ') clearly and entirely visible below it, with sufficient padding on all sides, particularly on the right.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, check `Row`, `Column`, `Expanded`, and `Text` `maxLines` and `overflow` properties. Ensure the `TextButton` or `InkWell`'s parent `Container` or `SizedBox` provides enough width. For web (CSS), check `overflow` properties on parent elements and ensure enough `padding-right` or `margin-right` for the button's container. Consider `white-space: nowrap` for the button text itself if it breaks.
```

### 🟡 Display reaction counts and make emojis clearly interactive

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** small | **Heuristic:** Recognition rather than recall

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users might miss opportunities to engage with posts or misunderstand the purpose of displayed emojis due to a lack of clear visual cues for interaction.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Fetch and display numerical counts for each reaction type (e.g., '🫡 5', '❤️ 10') adjacent to their respective emoji icon.
2. Wrap the entire reaction area (emojis + counts) in a clearly tappable component (e.g., `GestureDetector` or `InkWell` in Flutter, an interactive `div` with `onClick` for web).
3. Implement a clear visual feedback mechanism on tap or hover, such as a subtle background highlight, a slight scaling animation, or a change in text color, to indicate interactivity.
4. On tap, either navigate to a detailed view showing who reacted, or open a reaction picker for the user to add their own reaction.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the reaction emojis (e.g., 🫡, ❤️) each followed by a numerical count (e.g., '🫡 5', '❤️ 10'). Indicate that this entire area is interactive.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, use a `Row` containing `Text` widgets for emojis and counts, all wrapped in an `InkWell` or `GestureDetector` to handle taps. For web, use a flex container (`div` with `display: flex`) for the emojis and counts, applying `cursor: pointer` and appropriate `:hover` and `:active` CSS styles.
```

### 🟡 Re-evaluate spacing and visual weight of top-right header icons

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
The dense clustering of interactive icons can overwhelm users, increasing cognitive load and hindering quick scanning for specific actions.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Increase the horizontal margin or padding between the 'create post/story', 'search', and 'Messenger' icons in the top-right header.
2. Ensure each icon has a minimum touch target area of 48x48dp to improve tap accuracy, even if the visual icon size is smaller. This may involve adding transparent padding around the icon.
3. Consider slightly reducing the visual weight (e.g., stroke thickness, color saturation) of less critical icons to subtly differentiate primary actions if space remains a concern, without sacrificing discoverability.

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Illustrate the top-right header with the 'create post/story', 'search', and 'Messenger' icons having increased and consistent spacing between them, ensuring no visual overlap with badges.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, add `SizedBox(width: [spacing])` widgets between `IconButton`s within the `AppBar`'s `actions` list. For web (CSS), apply `margin-right` or use the `gap` property within a flex container (`display: flex; justify-content: flex-end; align-items: center; gap: [spacing];`).
```

### 🟡 Implement clear loading indicators for asynchronous actions

**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** medium | **Heuristic:** Visibility of system status

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Users experience anxiety and uncertainty, wonder if their input was received, or may mistakenly perform actions multiple times due to a lack of system feedback.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. **Post Creation (e.g., 'What's on your mind?'):** When a user initiates a post submission, show a `CircularProgressIndicator` directly within the submit button or a `LinearProgressIndicator` at the top of the screen. Disable the button during loading.
2. **Content Loading (e.g., feed refresh, 'load more'):** At the bottom of the feed, implement a `CircularProgressIndicator` or a skeleton loader when more posts are being fetched. For pull-to-refresh, use a standard platform-specific refresh indicator.
3. **Navigation to Creation Flow (e.g., tap 'create post/story' icon):** If opening the camera/gallery or a new creation screen involves a noticeable delay, display a temporary full-screen overlay with a spinner or a skeleton UI for the upcoming screen content.
4. For all successful submissions or actions, provide brief, positive feedback (e.g., `Snackbar` 'Post published!', a temporary checkmark icon, or a 'Submitted!' toast).

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show three scenarios: 1) A submit button (e.g., 'Post') with a spinner inside while loading. 2) The bottom of the feed showing a loading spinner as new content loads. 3) A placeholder/skeleton screen or full-screen spinner when navigating to a new feature that requires data fetch (like opening a camera/gallery for post creation).

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
Requires robust state management for loading states (e.g., `isLoading` boolean, `loadingProgress` value). For Flutter, use `AnimatedSwitcher` to swap between content and `CircularProgressIndicator`, or packages like `shimmer` for skeleton loaders. For web, manage loading states via React/Vue/Angular state or DOM manipulation, using CSS animations for spinners and skeleton loaders.
```

### 🟢 Remove redundant profile picture from post image

**Priority:** P3 | **Effort:** quick-win | **Heuristic:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### 💡 Why It Matters
Unnecessary visual clutter and information duplication detract from a clean aesthetic and can cause minor visual distraction without adding new value.

#### ✅ Implementation Steps
1. Locate the component responsible for rendering the small profile picture overlaid on the main post image (typically positioned in the bottom-right corner).
2. Remove this component from the post card's layout structure.
3. Verify that its removal does not affect any other functional aspects of the post or related interactions (e.g., tapping the main image).

#### 🎨 Wireframe Instructions
Show the main post image without any small, circular profile picture overlaid in its bottom-right corner. The author's profile picture in the header is sufficient.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
```
For Flutter, remove the `Positioned` widget containing the `CircleAvatar` from the `Stack` that displays the main post image. For web (CSS), remove the `img` element or `div` with a background image that uses `position: absolute` or similar positioning within the main image container.
```
