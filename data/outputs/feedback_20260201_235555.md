## Feedback Items

### 🟡 Implement loading indicators for content and search actions

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Users need immediate feedback to confirm their actions are registered and that the system is processing their request. Without visible loading states, users may become uncertain, frustrated, or assume the app is unresponsive, leading to repeated actions or abandonment.

**What to do:**
- When fetching content for sections like 'Popular near you,' display skeleton screens (placeholder shapes mimicking the content structure) or subtle spinners until the actual destination cards (e.g., 'Bromo Tengger Semeru Landscape', 'Gunung Andong Magelang Landscape') are loaded.
- Provide visual feedback for search initiation: when a user types into 'Search destination, ...' and performs a search, show a temporary spinner within the input field or disable the search button until results are displayed.
- If a search yields no results, clearly communicate this with a 'No results found' message rather than an empty screen.

**Wireframe changes:** Introduce skeleton loader components for the large image cards and text overlays in the 'Popular near you' section. Add a conditional small spinner icon within the 'Search destination' text input field. Design a 'No results' state UI for search.

### 🟢 Correct spelling errors and replace ambiguous icons

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Typos detract from the app's professionalism and can cause minor confusion. Ambiguous icons violate the principle of matching real-world conventions, forcing users to guess their meaning and reducing intuitiveness.

**What to do:**
- Change the placeholder text in the search input from 'Search destnation, ...' to 'Search destination, ...'.
- Correct the 'Montain' category button text to 'Mountain'.
- Replace the 'Distance/Wind Icon' with a more universally understood symbol for distance (e.g., a ruler, a walking person, or a simple arrow indicating distance/travel) to eliminate ambiguity.

**Wireframe changes:** Update text strings for the search input placeholder and the 'Mountain' category button. Replace the existing 'Distance/Wind Icon' graphic with a new icon that clearly represents distance.

### 🟡 Add a clear/cancel button to the search input field

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Users should have effortless control over their input. Lacking a dedicated clear button for the search field means users must manually delete text or rely on system-level controls, which is less efficient and reduces their sense of control.

**What to do:**
- Implement a small 'X' or 'Clear' icon within the 'Search destination, ...' text input field.
- This icon should become visible only when text has been entered into the field.
- Tapping the icon must immediately clear the input field's content, allowing users to quickly start a new search.

**Wireframe changes:** Add a conditionally visible small 'X' icon (e.g., dark gray color, small size) on the right side inside the 'Search destnation, ...' text input, next to the 'Search Magnifying Glass' icon.

### 🟢 Standardize text casing in the user profile header

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Inconsistent text casing, even for minor labels, can make an interface appear less polished and professional. Adhering to a consistent style guide improves visual harmony and strengthens the overall brand perception.

**What to do:**
- Establish a clear text casing standard for all labels and headings throughout the app (e.g., 'Sentence case' for descriptive labels, 'Title Case' for proper nouns and main headings).
- Apply the chosen standard consistently. For instance, if 'Sentence case' is preferred for descriptive labels, ensure 'Basic account' remains as is, and document the exception for proper nouns like 'Annie January'.

**Wireframe changes:** No direct wireframe change if 'Basic account' remains sentence case and 'Annie January' remains title case (as is common for proper nouns vs. descriptive phrases). However, document the specific text casing rule in the style guide.

### 🟡 Implement input validation and autocomplete for search and location fields

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Without proactive error prevention, users may input invalid or misspelled terms, leading to 'no results' screens, incorrect functionality, and increased frustration. Providing real-time feedback and suggestions guides users toward correct input and prevents errors before submission.

**What to do:**
- For the 'Jombang, IDN' location input field, integrate an autocomplete feature that suggests valid geographical locations as the user types.
- For the 'Search destination, ...' field, provide dynamic search suggestions based on common queries, trending destinations, or available content as the user types.
- If input is invalid or incomplete (e.g., malformed location, unsupported search term), provide immediate inline feedback (e.g., a red border around the input field, a small error message below it) rather than waiting for submission.

**Wireframe changes:** Design a dropdown list component that appears below the 'Jombang, IDN' and 'Search destnation, ...' text input fields, displaying suggestions as the user types. Introduce UI elements for inline error messages/indicators for invalid input.
