      "issue": "The UI description does not explicitly mention general loading indicators for content (e.g., when fetching products or sections) or clear visual/haptic feedback for user interactions like tapping on product cards or buttons (beyond the implied action of the button itself). While countdown timers are present, comprehensive system feedback for all user actions and content loading appears to be missing.",

      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "severity": "low",
      "issue": "The 'GET ALL' button for the 'New user gift' might trigger an immediate and potentially irreversible action (applying a discount or activating a gift) without a clear confirmation step or an easy way to undo if the user clicked it accidentally or wanted to save the offer for later. This limits user control over a potentially significant action.",

        "image_card (30% OFF SITEWIDE)"
      ],
      "improvement_suggestion": "For actions with immediate or significant consequences, like 'GET ALL', consider adding a confirmation dialog ('Are you sure you want to activate this gift?') or a clear explanation of what happens immediately after clicking the button, along with an option to reverse the action if possible."

  "strengths": [
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The UI effectively uses countdown timers (e.g., 'Free shipping Ends in 20:26:18', 'Lightning deals Ends in 20:26:18') and a progress bar in the cart navigation item to communicate crucial time-sensitive status and progress to the user, creating a sense of urgency and informing them of ongoing deals."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The UI utilizes familiar e-commerce language and concepts (e.g., 'Free shipping', 'New user gift', 'Lightning deals', '$X sold', 'Categories', 'Cart'). Icons like 'Search' and standard system icons are easily recognizable. The layout and content organization align well with common mobile shopping app patterns, reducing the cognitive load for users."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The UI demonstrates good consistency in its design. The brand color 'orange' is consistently used for the app name and primary call-to-action buttons ('GET ALL'), reinforcing brand identity and guiding user attention. Typography maintains a clear hierarchy, with consistent sizing and coloring for primary and secondary information (e.g., smaller, lighter text for old prices and 'sold' counts). Element spacing and density are described as comfortable, contributing to a coherent visual experience."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "observation": "While specific error prevention mechanisms like input validation are not described for a home screen, the clear visual hierarchy, distinct button styling (e.g., 'GET ALL' with white text on an orange background), and well-defined sections (e.g., 'New user gift', 'Lightning deals') inherently help prevent mis-taps and guide users to the intended interactions, reducing the likelihood of unintentional actions."
